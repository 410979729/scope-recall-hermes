# Changelog

All notable changes to `scope-recall` will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- Added vector audit stats for physical LanceDB row count, unique id count, and duplicate extra row count.
- Added regression coverage for duplicate vector row repair, stale vector row cleanup, vector upsert failure degradation, light top-level package import, and the intentional `on_memory_write` no-op boundary.
- Renamed public provider from `lancepro` to `scope-recall` with a deprecated compatibility shim left in place for the old plugin directory.
- Added SQLite truth store + LanceDB vector companion architecture for hybrid current-turn recall.
- Added scope isolation coverage for `chat_id`, `thread_id`, and `gateway_session_key`.
- Added focused release docs: migration notes, upstream differences, and OpenClaw import guidance.
- Added idempotent OpenClaw import tooling with stable source fingerprints and an `import_ledger`.
- Added release bootstrap files: `pyproject.toml`, `.gitignore`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Added GitHub Actions CI and a local `scripts/check.release.py` gate for test/build/secret/path/artifact verification.
- Added `scripts/repair.vector_index.py` to rebuild the LanceDB companion from SQLite truth with backup support.

### Changed
- Switched active Hermes memory provider to `scope-recall`.
- Refactored provider internals by splitting migration logic, recall fusion, capture flow, storage views, and tool handling into dedicated modules.
- Changed vector maintenance from init-time full rebuild toward incremental sync by stable row id and `updated_at`, including stale-row cleanup and duplicate physical-row repair.
- Clarified README and DESIGN documentation to describe the real runtime architecture, configured Gemini OpenAI-compatible default embedder, and local fallback boundary.
- Updated release regression coverage so the default runtime path explicitly verifies fallback to `local-hash` when API embeddings are unavailable, while dimension-rebuild coverage uses an explicit local-hash config override.
- Fixed wheel packaging so the published artifact installs as an importable `scope_recall` package instead of scattering provider modules at site-packages top level.
- Restored Python 3.10/3.11 compatibility in `vector_store.py` by removing 3.12-only f-string quoting syntax.
- Included the OpenClaw import script in wheel data files for public release completeness.
- Preserved SQLite truth writes when LanceDB delete/upsert fails and marked the vector layer `needs_repair` for later repair.
- Kept top-level `import scope_recall` free of Hermes runtime imports; `register()` lazy-loads provider code.
- Documented `on_memory_write` as an intentional observational no-op because curated memory files are live-read instead of mirrored.
- Replaced dynamic `ALTER TABLE` f-string construction with an explicit allowlisted migration mapping and changed test placeholder keys to obvious non-secrets.

### Compatibility
- Legacy `lancepro_store`, `lancepro_search`, and `lancepro_stats` aliases remain accepted during transition.
- Legacy `$HERMES_HOME/lancepro/` SQLite/config storage is migrated forward on first initialization.

### Known limitations
- Vector repair/rebuild is available through `scripts/repair.vector_index.py`, but live gateway runtime freshness still requires an explicit service restart / human-triggered verification after deployment.
- OpenClaw historical imports still require an explicit one-shot import step; they are not automatically reused.
